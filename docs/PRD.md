# CourseFlow Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Version:** 1.0  
**Date:** October 29, 2025  
**Product Owner:** Tom Tarpey  
**Target Audience:** Technical Team (Frontend, Backend, AI), Non-Technical Stakeholders (PM, Design, Marketing), AI/ML Engineers

---

## 1. Elevator Pitch

**CourseFlow** is an **AI-powered course optimization platform** that empowers online course creators to **maximize student engagement and learning outcomes** by analyzing course content, tracking real-time student interactions, and delivering **actionable, personalized recommendations** for course improvement.

> *“Upload your course. Understand your students. Optimize for success — automatically.”*

---

## 2. Executive Summary

CourseFlow bridges the gap between course creation and data-driven optimization. It uses **AI to analyze content structure, student behavior, and learning patterns**, then delivers **clear, prioritized recommendations** to improve course flow, engagement, and completion rates.

Built for **independent course creators, instructional designers, and LMS administrators**, CourseFlow integrates seamlessly into existing workflows and scales with course complexity.

## 3. Market Analysis

| Aspect | Insight |
|------|--------|
| **Market Size** | Global online education market: **$325B by 2025** |
| **Growth Drivers** | Rising competition, demand for engagement, retention pressure |
| **Current Gaps** | Manual analysis, basic analytics, no AI-driven course structure optimization |
| **Competitive Edge** | **AI-powered structural + behavioral insights**, not just usage stats |

---

## 4. User Personas

### **Primary: Fred – Online Course Creator**
- **Role:** Independent educator on Udemy, Teachable, or self-hosted
- **Goals:** Increase completion rates, boost ratings, grow enrollments
- **Pain Points:** 
  - Can’t see *where* students drop off
  - Unsure if content is too dense, boring, or misordered
  - No time for manual analytics
- **Needs:** Simple upload → clear recommendations → fast wins

### **Secondary: Samantha – Instructional Designer**
- **Role:** Builds courses for institutions or agencies
- **Needs:** Validate structure, align with learning science, iterate quickly

### **Tertiary: Alex – Course Administrator**
- **Role:** Manages 10+ courses
- **Needs:** Dashboard of engagement trends, bulk optimization suggestions

---

## 5. Problem Statement

> **Online course creators lack actionable, AI-driven insights into how students actually experience their content — leading to high dropout rates (70%+ on average) and stagnant course performance.**

### Core Problems:
1. **Blind Spots in Content Flow** – No visibility into pacing, difficulty spikes, or confusion points
2. **Fragmented Student Data** – Interactions scattered across platforms
3. **No Personalization at Scale** – One-size-fits-all courses underperform
4. **Manual Optimization is Impractical** – Too slow, subjective, and unscalable
